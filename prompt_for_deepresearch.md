Build a comprehensive guide on the new DeepSeek-R1 model.

- The story behind it
- What it is 
- Key methologies used
- How it differentiates (pricing, capabilities, etc.) from other competitive models like o1 and Gemini Flash Thinking.
- Implications for the AI industry
- The usage trends and key metrics showing its adoption
- Where it's being applied such as use cases and domains
- What other research efforts it has enabled
- How developers are using it such as prompting tricks, hacks, or usage patterns
- Coding examples
- Learning resources

Feel free to use charts, tables, or any other format in your outputs. This guide will be shared publicly to aid researchers and developers so please make sure it's accurate, informative, and provides as much useful details as possible.

Before I begin the research, could you clarify a few details:

- Are you looking for a technical deep dive (e.g., architecture, parameter count, training methods) or a more general overview?
- Do you have a preferred structure or format for the guide (e.g., a report with sections, a blog-style article, or a mix of tables, charts, and text)?
- Would you like comparisons with specific competitive models such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Mistral, or Meta’s LLaMA, beyond O1 and Gemini Flash Thinking?
- Do you need references to academic papers, GitHub repositories, or official documentation?
- Should the guide be written in a formal academic tone, a developer-friendly practical style, or a mix of both?

Let me know so I can tailor the guide to your needs!

Yes, do a technical deep dive. A report with sections but feel free to use tables and charts where it could be useful. Yes, do comparisons with models like Gemini Flash Thinking, o1, and o3. Yes, provide as much references as possible. Use a mix of both academic and developer friendly practical style where it applies.

Got it! I’ll conduct a thorough technical deep dive into the DeepSeek-R1 model, structured as a detailed report covering:

The story behind its development
Technical specifications and key methodologies
How it differentiates from competitors (Gemini Flash Thinking, O1, O3, etc.) in terms of pricing, capabilities, and architecture
Implications for the AI industry
Adoption trends, key metrics, and real-world applications
Research impact and contributions to AI advancements
Developer usage patterns, prompting techniques, and coding examples
Learning resources and references
I’ll also include tables, charts, and links to relevant research papers and repositories where applicable. I’ll get back to you with the report once it's ready.
